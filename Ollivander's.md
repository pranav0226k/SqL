Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.

Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age. 

Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power. 

If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age.

Code:
----
SELECT w.id, wp.age, w.coins_needed, w.power

FROM Wands w

JOIN Wands_Property wp 

    ON w.code = wp.code

WHERE wp.is_evil = 0

  AND w.coins_needed = (
  
        SELECT MIN(w1.coins_needed)
        
        FROM Wands w1
        
        JOIN Wands_Property wp1 
        
            ON w1.code = wp1.code
        
        WHERE wp1.is_evil = 0
        
          AND w1.power = w.power
          
          AND wp1.age = wp.age
    )

ORDER BY w.power DESC, wp.age DESC;

    
ORDER BY w.power DESC, wp.age DESC;
